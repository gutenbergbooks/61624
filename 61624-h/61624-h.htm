  <h2 class='c006'>THE FALL OF ULYSSES<br /> <span class='large'><i>An Elephant Story</i></span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c007'>I cannot
deny that I was
entirely to
blame for the
calamity that
overtook
Ulysses; and if I call attention
to the high social
and literary standing of
the gentleman whom I
employed as an accomplice
in the affair, it is
not at all with the hope of
thereby lessening my own
responsibility. It is certain
that I furnished the
unfortunate creature the
cause for his desperation.
I ought also to confess
that I felt a sense of
profound relief when he
accepted the only means
apparent to his limited
understanding of freeing
himself from his dilemma.
But what was I to do?
When a man has an
elephant on his hands he
should be judged with a
kindly consideration for
the awkwardness of his
situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>My elephant was decidedly
more trying than
the average variety, for
the reason that he was
not metaphorical, but
real. What I mean is,
that I am not speaking in
figurative language about
some officious friend or
troublesome relative, but
about a genuine Asiatic
elephant, Ulysses by
name, who came into my
possession several years
ago, and of whom I have
but recently managed to
rid myself. Physically he
was a well-developed
specimen, having no
special characteristics to
distinguish him from the
rest of his kind. Intellectually,
however, he was
a species of monster, and
I was the unfortunate
Frankenstein that was
responsible for his existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>The purchase was
effected by a series of
complicated negotiations,
carried on in my behalf
by a half breed elephant
trainer, known as Jerry
Rhahob, with the owner
of Ulysses. Had I undertaken
the job myself I
might have found an
elephant a more expensive
luxury than I cared to
possess. My agent, the
half breed, had the
reputation of knowing
more than any man in
Madras about the habits
and characteristics of
elephants and the means
by which they could be
most successfully trained.
For some time he had
been in charge of the
yards where the animals
owned by the British
government were prepared
for service in war or road
building. Before setting
out for my bungalow, I
thought best to consult
with Jerry, who spoke
English perfectly, as to
the course of education to
which I proposed treating
Ulysses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I intend to teach this
animal all that an elephant
can be made to learn,”
said I.</p>

<p class='c008'>“You will not have
time to do that,” said
Jerry, significantly.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Do you mean,” I
asked, “that there is no
limit to what an elephant
can be taught?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“My experience has
led me to believe that it
depends upon the patience
of the man, and not upon
the capacity of the brute,
how far the instruction
may be carried.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” I said; “I
shall have patience.
What I most need is
advice about gaining the
creature’s confidence and
affection.”</p>

<p class='c008'>The fact that I am a
bachelor does not prevent
my entertaining an
extensive code of opinions
on the subject of the
proper rearing of children.
The suggestions of Jerry
Rhahob on the training
of elephants seemed to me
much the same that I
would have offered a
young and inexperienced
parent if he had applied
to me for advice about his
offspring. Reduced to its
fundamental principles,
Jerry’s theory was that an
elephant should be regarded
as a dumb and
deformed human being,
possessed of a keen
appreciation of right and
wrong, delicate sensibilities,
exceptional capacity
and high character. From
the mental and moral
qualities with which
Jerry’s conception seemed
to endow this being, I
would have accorded him
a place in the human
species, among the class
that is said to be born and
not made, the “genus
irritable.”</p>

<p class='c008'>One piece of warning
he gave me in conclusion.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The elephant knows
as well as you do,” said
he, “that he is an animal
and you are a man. He
appreciates the distinction.
He understands that he
is your physical superior,
and that he could by a
single blow of his trunk
dash the life out of you.
As long as he is kindly
treated he will feel no
desire to exercise that
power. In the matter of
intellect he appreciates
that you are greatly above
him, and will obey and
serve you for that reason.
Let him once get it into
his head, however, that
his powers are on a level
with your own, and his
arrogance will become
insupportable. The relationship
will be suddenly
reversed, and you will
find yourself no longer
his master, but his servant.
Several years ago I had
a very intelligent elephant
here in the yards whom I
employed to build stone
walls. He became
marvelously expert at it,
picking out just the right
shaped rocks to fill the
spaces with the best
economy. The stones are
irregular in form, and you
can imagine that no small
degree of skill is required.
On one occasion he stood
near watching me while I
endeavored to teach a
younger elephant how the
work was to be done. I
built several feet of wall,
but the job was not a
successful one—not, at
least, when compared
with what Budan could
do. Whenever I picked
up the wrong stone he
gave a snort, and indicated
a better one with
his trunk. At last he could
stand it no longer, and
brushing me aside, took
hold of the work himself,
and soon had the young
one taught. After that
he made no secret of his
contempt for me. I saw
that he was ruining
my standing with the
rest of the herd, and
I had to send him away.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This story would have
seemed quite ridiculous
to me if I had not heard
many others more
wonderful pass current
without question, and had
I not often seen elephants
employed in Madras at
work which in America
would be assigned only
to artisans of considerable
skill.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Believe anything you
are told about the intelligence
of an elephant,”
said a traveler from India
to me once, before I
visited that country; “the
chances are it is true.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I engaged an experienced
mahout, or
driver, an intelligent
native by the name of
Akbar. I determined,
however, to make use of
his services just as little
as possible, in order that
Ulysses might learn to
depend upon myself alone.
I attended personally
to the matter of food and
drink, and took pains that
my protegé should receive
no favors from the
hand of anyone else. I
soon learned the things
that gave him pleasure,
and put myself to no little
trouble to gratify him on
every possible occasion.
I continued this process,
combining with it instruction
in such small services
as “house elephants” in
India are always expected
to perform, until I saw
that I had completely
gained his confidence
and affection. During
this period of his
tutelage, Ulysses would
have trusted and obeyed
me to any extent. I think
he would willingly have
laid down his life or
endured torture for my
sake. Nothing made
him happier than to be
near me as I sat under
the banyan tree in my
garden, smoking and
reading. When I opened
his stall in the mornings
and called to him to come
out, he fairly quivered
with joy at the sound of
my voice, and gave vent
to his satisfaction at
seeing me by shrill trumpetings.
His devotion
was annoying at times,
and one of the first difficulties
that I experienced was
in teaching him to be less
demonstrative.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a fact, which
most readers of this
narrative have proved for
themselves by actual experiment,
that animals
may be taught the
meaning of words. An
intelligent dog, for
example possesses a considerable
vocabulary. I
proposed to undertake a
systematic course of
instruction in the English
language with Ulysses
and to ascertain to what
extent he was capable of
acquiring our vernacular.
Whenever he learned a
new word I made a note
of it in a book, and by
constant review contrived
to fix it in his memory.
As soon as he began to
comprehend what my
purpose was, as he did
after I had been laboring
with him a couple of
weeks, he became very
eager to learn, and greatly
increased the rapidity of
the work.</p>

<p class='c008'>The process of teaching
him nouns was simple
and easy. Each day I
would produce several
new articles, tell him their
names, and have him
hand them to me as I
called for them. I taught
him to say “yes” and “no”
by the waving of his
trunk, and made him
appreciate that he was to
use that means of signifying
to me whether
he understood me or
not.</p>

<p class='c008'>After I was well into
the work, the morning
lesson would go somewhat
as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you ready for
your lesson, Ulysses?”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulysses lifts his trunk
affirmatively. Although
he does not understand
“lesson,” the word “ready”
is clear to him by frequent
use.</p>

<p class='c008'>I hold out a ball, a new
object.</p>

<p class='c008'>“This is a ball, Ulysses;
a ball.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I repeat it several
times, until the sound has
fastened itself in his memory.
Then I lay it on
the table with a pipe, a
cup and a book. I ask for
them, one after another,
and he hands them to me.
I add numerous other
objects, the names of which
he has already learned,
and thus combine review
with advance instruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Together with the noun
“ball” I teach him the
verbs “roll,” “throw” and
“drop,” and perhaps an
adverb or two like “fast”
or “slowly,” and an adjective,
“round.” Sometimes
there is an awkward
hitch and I have to
abandon the attempt to
teach him some particular
word, referring to it again
when his vocabulary has
been increased in some
other direction.</p>

<p class='c008'>A certain point once
passed, it was surprising
with what rapidity I proceeded.
One word led to
another, a number of
words to phrases and
these to complete sentences.
I finally dropped
into a way of talking to
him about the objects
with which we were
working, much as I would
have talked to a bright
child. I was conscious at
times that only a small
part of what I was saying
was understood, but it
accustomed him to hearing
the words that he
knew, used in association
with others to form
complete statements.</p>

<p class='c008'>In my search for objects
to use in the instruction
of Ulysses I happened
upon a lump of chalk.
With this I sketched
various things on a smooth
plank of dark wood, and
found that they were
readily recognized by my
pupil. From this I suddenly
conceived a new
idea. I sent to Madras
and had a large, firm
blackboard made and
ordered chalk and erasers.
Then I began a systematic
and determined effort to
teach Ulysses to read and
write.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one element
that enters into all teaching,
of which it is difficult
to give any conception in
a narrative of results, and
that is time. I had been
steadily at work with
Ulysses for nearly a year
before I began to use the
blackboard, and after I
adopted that assistant it
was many months ere
important results began to
show themselves. Any
one who has ever labored
with a well-meaning but
obtuse pupil, will appreciate
how slow and
discouraging at times my
work must have been. He
will also understand how
the progress, trifling, when
considered day by day,
amounted to a good deal
when viewed in the
aggregate.</p>

<p class='c008'>I readily taught Ulysses
to hold the chalk in the
fingers of his proboscis,
and to mark with it upon
the blackboard. He
understood that he was
to imitate, as nearly as
possible, the marks that I
made. In this way I
taught him to print the
letters of the English
alphabet in clumsy characters
several inches in
size. Gradually he became
more expert in making
them, and learned the
names by which they were
called. It was a great
triumph for me when I
first succeeded in getting
him to write the letters of
his own name as I called
them off, and saw myself
the proud possessor of an
elephant who could write
his autograph, perhaps
the first of his species that
ever performed that
enlightened but compromising
feat.</p>

<p class='c008'>All this was easy
enough, but to make him
comprehend that certain
groups of these peculiar
marks formed pictures,
which were to suggest
definite objects to him, was
a very different sort of an
undertaking. The hitch
in the proceedings at this
point was so serious that,
for a time, I gave up all
hope of accomplishing my
object. It seemed impossible
to establish the
necessary connection in
his mind between the
written characters and
the spoken word. At last,
it suddenly dawned upon
him, and he learned (fatal
omen!) the word “book.”
The acquiring of one
word constituted the test
in my calculations. That
point being gained, the
rest was only a question
of additional work and
continued patience.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was not long before
Ulysses could write upon
the board the names of
most of the objects that
had been used in his instruction
thus far, and the
verbs that I had taught
him in connection with
them. To combine these
words into sentences was
largely a matter of imitation,
for he had already
come to understand them
when so arranged. In a
short time we were
carrying on long conferences,
and the vocabulary
of Ulysses had increased
to the point of embracing
most of the words used in
daily conversation. With
the establishment of this
mode of inter-communication,
Ulysses was able
to explain to me what his
difficulties were, and I
could proffer more
available assistance. I
then, for the first time,
enjoyed an intimate
acquaintance with a brain
that was not human. I
could look into it and
study its character and
mode of action. I need
not add that the occupation
was a fascinating one.
Our conversations, which
were at first limited to
visible actions and concrete
objects, soon strayed
into abstractions. The
rapidity with which he
grasped the analogy
between seeing and thinking,
and lifted himself out
of the material into the
metaphysical plane,
astonished me beyond
measure. He possessed
an over-ruling sense of
logic, keen and penetrating,
and yet so swift that
it seemed transfigured to
intuition. But the most
wonderful feature of his
intellect was his memory.
Now that words were
supplied him, as tools
with which to conduct his
thinking, what were before
mere vague impressions,
became definite ideas,
fixed and everlasting. I
soon found that it was
necessary to be absolutely
accurate in all that I said
to him, as he was quick
to detect any inconsistency,
and his memory
covered the full amount
of all that I had said since
he had come to have
command of the language.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some time we
conversed together every
day, I talking or writing,
and he using the blackboard.
As print was too
slow for practical use, I
taught him to write short-hand.
One day he made
some inquiry of me
concerning the novel I
happened to have in
hand, and I read him
several chapters of it. His
delight at gaining so much
knowledge in so short a
time was unbounded. I
discovered that he regarded
it as authentic history,
and hastened to undeceive
him. He was greatly
shocked to find that
anything could be said
or written which was not
true. This led me into
something of a dissertation
upon the forms of literature
and the canons of
taste. He listened with
an absorbed interest. The
bent of his mind was
evidently not practical,
but literary and artistic.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_43.jpg' alt='“_Ulysses was now ready to begin his literary researches._”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>Ulysses’ fondness for
hearing me read gave me
an idea as to a means of
freeing myself from the
importunities for instruction
and discussion to
which he was now treating
me, and which were becoming
decidedly irksome.
I sent Akbar, the mahout,
to Madras with a letter
to a French oculist. He
brought back a large
monocle which I had
ordered made for the use
of my pupil. There was
a hole in one of Ulysses’
ears, drilled there by some
former, less appreciative
owner, through which I
passed a light silk cord,
allowing the glass to hang
conveniently pendant. I
had a wooden rack constructed
by a neighboring
rayat, who did carpenter
work, which held the
volume open and at the
right altitude. Ulysses
was now ready to begin
his literary researches
independent of my aid.
Kneeling before the rack,
in which he soon learned
to fasten the book himself,
he lifted the monocle to
his eye, with the fingers
of his trunk, and commenced
to read. At first
he proceeded slowly, and
was often compelled to
summon me to his assistance.
After I explained
to him the use of the
dictionary and allowed
him to keep one near at
hand, this source of
annoyance ceased, and he
worked away by himself
with a steadily increasing
ease and rapidity.</p>

<p class='c008'>There was one person
who had observed all
these proceedings with
astonishment and disapproval.
This was Briggs,
the English gardener who
took care of my place. I
think he had an idea that
I was violating the laws
of the Church of England
in some way, I scarcely
know how. On one
occasion, when I happened
to be in Madras,
Ulysses discovered, by
appealing to him for the
meaning of certain words
and phrases, that all
mortals were not endowed
with the same fund of information
that I happened
to possess. No sooner
did he find out that
Briggs knew less about
such matters than he did
himself than he began to
treat him with open contempt,
slowly bringing
up his eyeglass and inspecting
him with cold
hauteur whenever he
happened to come in
sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>“That there helephant,”
Briggs complained to me,
“do treat me most harrogant,
sir. I didn’t
never expect to come to
this ’ere.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I spoke to Ulysses
about the matter, and remonstrated
with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I cannot understand
it,” he wrote in reply. “I
asked the man about
Schopenhauer’s Four-fold
Root of Sufficient Reason
to which I found a reference
in a volume of essays
by Frederic Harrison.
He said he never had
heard of any such root.
Can he not read and talk
as you do, and as all
mortals do? How does
it happen that he is ignorant
of these things?”</p>

<p class='c008'>I explained to him that
only a small part of the
human race was interested
in affairs of the intellect,
and that millions of men
were still in the condition
of unhappy mental blindness
from which he had
so recently emerged. He
was aghast at this
statement, but it did not
tend to re-establish Briggs
in his respect.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was now the season
of the year when I was
accustomed to make a
tour among the neighboring
coffee plantations, to
estimate and bid on the
crops. I was not able
to take Ulysses with me
conveniently, so I left him
in the care of Briggs and
Akbar. To Briggs I gave
the key to my library,
with orders to supply
Ulysses with whatever he
might demand, and I prepared
for my pupil’s use a
catalogue of all the books
in my collection. The
library was chiefly made
up of works of history,
philosophy and criticism,
admirably suited to the
special tastes of Ulysses.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_50.jpg' alt='“_To Briggs I gave the key to my library, with orders to supply Ulysses with whatever he might demand._”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>My absence lasted
during a period of nearly
three months, and on my
return I found Ulysses
almost in a condition of
“must,” or insanity. He
had read all, or nearly all,
the books that I had
placed upon the list, and
had gained through that
extraordinary memory of
his an immense mass of
fact and opinion. He
was now suffering from
intellectual dyspepsia. I
consulted him about his
troubles, and got in reply
an avalanche of questions
on every variety of subject.
His confidence in my
knowledge was, apparently,
unlimited. It would
have been a source of
inexpressible gratification
to me if I could have
shared it.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was not unmindful of
the fate which had befallen
poor Briggs, nevertheless
I felt it my duty to help
Ulysses out of his difficulties.
I did not imagine
that his questions would
occasion me much trouble,
and if they should, I
thought myself the possessor
of sufficient savoir
faire to get out of it in
some way. I avoided
some things merely by
assuring him that he
would understand them
better when he had read
more. When I essayed
an answer to any of his
interrogatories, he had an
unpleasant habit of pinning
me down to exact
statements and definite
opinions. I had never
appreciated the extent and
variety of my ignorance
until it was subjected to
this test; and although
Ulysses’ attitude toward
me was always that of
pupil to teacher, yet I
saw at times traces of the
Socratic method in the
long series of questions
that he put to me, and I
was compelled, not infrequently,
to squirm out of
some inconsistency in
most undignified fashion.</p>

<p class='c008'>This inquisition continued
for a number of
days after my return, and
I could not close my eyes
to the fact that I was failing
to hold my own in the
estimation of Ulysses.
From a cyclopedia of
literature, which happened
to be in my library,
Ulysses had stored his
mind with an enormous
fund of information on
subjects of which I was
completely ignorant. In
this field I was continually
falling into traps. There
were also translations of
Comte and Hegel, to
which he had devoted
considerable study, but I
checkmated him there by
talking wordy nonsense,
which I was sure he could
not distinguish from metaphysics.
It was evident,
however, that he was
beginning to appreciate
that something was the
matter. Although he had
not come to the point of
ranking me with Briggs,
still my position was
getting to be a precarious
one, and I saw the necessity
for great care.</p>

<p class='c008'>For some time I avoided
being drawn into
conversation with Ulysses,
keeping him at bay with
a number of new books,
which I had brought with
me from Madras. He
was not long in appreciating
that there was some
purpose lying back of this
policy, and demanded an
explanation of me. I was
confused by his point
blank questions, and only
managed to make things
worse. After that I was
clay in his hands. Every
day he branched out into
some new field of discussion,
tested me and found
me wanting. I tried in
vain to conceal my failures
under a dignified exterior.
Ulysses at first seemed
pained and surprised, but
there finally showed itself
in his bearing toward me
an air of satisfaction and
triumph, which was not
easy to endure. To have
been arrogantly treated
by a member of my own
species would have been
a new experience to me,
and one which I would
have vigorously resented;
this exhibition of superciliousness
from an animal
below me in the scale of
creation was more than I
proposed to put up with.</p>

<p class='c008'>One morning, as I
sauntered out to the
banyan tree, wondering
what was to be the outcome
of this absurd situation,
Ulysses motioned
to me, and pointed to
the blackboard, which I
saw was covered with
finely written characters.</p>

<p class='c008'>“No, Ulysses,” I said,
“I am tired this morning,
and it is very hot. I do
not wish to get into a
discussion with you.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulysses waved his
trunk emphatically, and
pointed again to the
blackboard. Then he
gave a fierce trumpet, and
glared at me in a way
that gave me a start of
terror.</p>

<p class='c008'>I saw that some sort of
a crisis was ahead, but
determined to defer it, if
possible, until I could
decide what was the best
course to pursue. I approached
the board and
read the following
message, addressed to
myself:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Master—You are deceived
if you think I am
ignorant of the change
which has gradually come
to pass in our relationship.
You have been my superior
thus far in life, not by
reason of your greater
physical power, for I can
strike you dead with one
blow, whereas you, without
the aid of tools, could
not give me even external
pain. Your sole claim to
command over me lay in
your intellectual superiority.
This superiority
I am now compelled to
question. Yesterday you
admitted that you had
never read any of Henry
Mackenzie’s novels; you
showed complete ignorance
concerning Bishop
Berkeley’s Alciphron;
and when I asked why
Henry Vaughn, the poet,
was called the ‘Silurist,’
you had no answer to
give me. In the conversations
of the last few days
you have made countless
blunders in matters of
history, science and
literature. Your ideas in
metaphysics are those of
a dotard, and your judgment
in belles-lettres is
execrable. I do not see
on what ground you
arrogate to yourself a
position above me. If
you are not entitled to the
place that I have given
you in my consideration,
if the idea which I have
entertained with regard
to our respective positions
is erroneous, then it is
clearly a matter of justice
that we should straightway
change places. I
will be the master hereafter
and you the servant.
Can you show me any
good reason why this
revolution should not
come to pass?”</p>

<p class='c008'>There was no mistaking
the tone and purport
of this communication.
It was at once a declaration
of independence and
a manifesto of sovereignty.
Not merely must
I exercise no more
authority over Ulysses,
but I must yield gracefully
and submissively to his
rule. I did not know,
either by experience or
hearsay, what kind of a
master an elephant would
make, but from the intensely
logical quality
that Ulysses had always
shown, I had a suspicion
that he would prove at
least severe and intolerant.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dilemma was a
hard one. I took up the
chalk, intending to write
my answer rather than
speak it, that I might have
time for reflection. As I
did so, an idea suddenly
occurred to me—a plan
by which I could beat
Ulysses at his own game.
I immediately became so
confident of its success
that I did not hesitate to
stake my personal liberty
on the chance of his discomfiture.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ulysses,” I said, “I
cannot deny that in many
directions you have shown
a mental grasp that I
never expected to see developed
elsewhere than
among the best of my own
species. But all this is
not enough. There is
still one test, the last and
severest to which culture
and intelligence may be
submitted. If you can
meet this satisfactorily, I
shall no longer question
your superiority over
myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“That is all I ask,”
wrote Ulysses, “a fair
trial.”</p>

<p class='c008'>I stepped into the
house, and returned with
a book which I had recently
brought from
Madras, and which Ulysses
had not seen. I laid it
open upon the rack before
him. He brought up his
monocle and glanced at
the title and the author.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Aha!” he wrote; “I
have heard of this man,
and have long wished to
see some of his work.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“You know what position
he occupies in
letters?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I do,” wrote Ulysses;
“I have read what his admirers
say of him.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Very well,” I answered;
“you know, then,
what is demanded of you—that
you should understand
and enjoy this work.
If you cannot meet both
these requirements, then
you have failed.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulysses shrugged his
trunk with easy indifference,
raised his eye glass,
and began to read. I lay
some distance away,
dozing in my hammock,
and awaited results. They
were not long in coming.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the end of about
half an hour he trumpeted
to me in an indignant
tone of voice, and inquired
on the blackboard whether
I had given him the
original English or some
kind of a translation.</p>

<p class='c008'>I answered this satisfactorily,
and for more
than an hour he toiled
away, breathing hard at
times and swaying from
side to side, whenever he
thought he was about to
find a clew.</p>

<p class='c008'>Presently he called to
me again.</p>

<p class='c008'>“I forgot to ask,” said
he, “whether this was to be
read backwards or sideways.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Straight ahead,” I
answered.</p>

<p class='c008'>I saw that he was
getting involved in the
toils, and knew that they
would soon close on him.
It must be remembered
that I had never deceived
Ulysses, and the thought
that I, or any one else,
could feign an opinion
which was not genuine,
had never occurred to
him. The book had been
submitted to him about
the middle of the morning.
Ulysses took no refreshment
that day, neither
water nor food. When I
came out of the house
after “tiffin,” I advised
him to lay the volume
aside, and look at it again
the next day. He seemed
to feel that this would be
a confession of failure, and
refused.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Tell me,” he wrote,
“are there many of your
species that understand
and really enjoy this
book?”</p>

<p class='c008'>“They are not many
in number,” I answered;
“but their position in the
society of culture and
taste is an exalted one.
Within the last few years
it has come to pass that
the understanding and appreciation
of this work is
a shibboleth by which the
true disciples of sweetness
and light may distinguish
themselves from the
miscellaneous herd of
Philistines. Do not be
discouraged because you
have failed,” I added, in
a kindly, patronizing tone.
“There are many estimable
mortals in the same
situation. You understand,
however, that you
cannot be admitted to the
elect, much less claim
superiority to myself.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulysses wrote upon
the blackboard several
profane expressions, which
I suppose he had learned
from Briggs, and resumed
his study.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was nearly evening
when Akbar came to me,
and said that Ulysses was
showing decided symptoms
of becoming “must.”
I went out with the intention
of taking the book
away from him, but
stopped several yards
away, struck by his
changed appearance. His
eyes were wild and bloodshot,
his ears erect, his
legs spread apart. He
was beating his sides with
his trunk, and at times
trumpeting in low, bass
tones. When he saw us
approach he seized the
book from the rack and
dashed it at me with all
his force.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Ulysses,” I said,
“keep calm.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“Look out!” cried
Akbar; “he is ‘must.’
Beware!”</p>

<p class='c008'>With a terrific roar
Ulysses turned, and
sprang in great, ponderous
leaps out of the
garden. Briggs, who
was in his path, dropped
his rake and flung
himself into some bushes.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_76.jpg' alt='“_Look out!” cried Akbar; “He is ‘must.’ Beware!_”' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c008'>“After him, Akbar!” I
cried; “see where he
goes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Ulysses ran toward a
clump of woods, which
grew over a knoll a short
distance away. Into this
he plunged, and was soon
out of sight. We could
hear the limbs crash as
he tore away into the
thick foliage. Akbar followed
cautiously. The
direction which Ulysses
had taken caused a suspicion
of possible calamity
to dawn on my mind, and
I waited uneasily for the
mahout’s return. It was
not long before Akbar
emerged from the woods
and ran toward me.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Praise be to our
fathers, he is dead!” he
shouted. Akbar had
come to fear and hate
Ulysses.</p>

<p class='c008'>“Are you sure?” I
asked.</p>

<p class='c008'>“May the hyenas eat
my grandfather!” said
he, solemnly. “You, who
know only the truth, remember
the rocky bank
beyond the hill, which
slopes off to destruction?
Your servant, Ulysses,
rushed thither and flung
himself down, bursting his
head against the stones.
I myself saw him there,
lying motionless and
dead.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This was the end of
Ulysses. I have already
remarked at the beginning
of this narrative that I
felt less of sorrow than of
relief over the catastrophe.
Long association had
made him dear to me in
many ways, yet I was not
prepared to endure him
as master. There could
be no other outcome to
the unhappy situation
than a tragedy of some
kind. I sadly gave orders
for the interment of his
body, and returned to the
house, taking with me the
torn and disfigured copy
of Browning’s “Sordello.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Note by the Author.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The reason that
prompted Ulysses’ master
to select “Sordello” as the
agent of his discomfiture
was, no doubt, that of all
the blind and obscure
work of the great poet,
this is generally rated the
most mysterious and perplexing.
In the days
when the Browning conflict
raged, “Sordello” was
the touchstone of the cult.
To refresh the reader’s
memory of its difficulties,
here are reproduced a few
passages taken almost at
random from the poem.
None of these is dependent
on context for
meaning, so they constitute
a fair test; and the
reader can put himself in
Ulysses’ place.</p>
